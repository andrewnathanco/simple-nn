# simple_neural_network
This is a simple, single perception neural network coded from scratch using the random library. It is inspired by the Coding Train's Neural Network tutorials. 
The data set is in csv format and has random x/y values and whether or not the pair is above the line y=x. If it is above the line the value is +1, if it is below the line it is -1.
The algorithm takes any 2 dimensional array and returns any scalar output.
